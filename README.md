# Scanning Microphone

This is a repository for the scanning microphone setup used as a possible way of imaging a phononic topological metamaterial. We are essentially using a CNC controlled microphone to record audio samples from different locations in our acoustic metamaterial (similar to the StM). This allows us to get high-resolution images of the acoustic dynamics of our system. 

__TODO: Add an image here of us scanning!__

As seen from the picture, our setup is divided into a few major sections, all of which have to be connected to your computer.

## Setup and Installation

### CNC Machine

The two main types of CNC machines that I experimented with was a 3D printer and a CNC mill. I felt like the 3D printers were safer to use, since you can send commands to turn off the heat and extruder. The setup instructions can be found [here.](printer/INSTRUCTIONS.md)

### Microphone

The two main types of microphones that were used were ones connected to the serial headphone jack, and oscilloscopes connected directly to the computer. The oscilloscopes were used because some of the frequencies used went over 22 kHz, which normal sound cards don't handle. The setup instructions can be found [here.](microphone/INSTRUCTIONS.md)
