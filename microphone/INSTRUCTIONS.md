# Microphone Setup


This section concerns setting up a microphone that is connected to the
computer's sound card. For example, something that is connected to the serial
microphone jack on most desktops. A lot of our testing images were imaged using
regular microphones, but for higher frequencies we used the Oscilloscope connection.

For most of the metamaterial imaging I recommend using the oscilloscope
and performing the FFT on the oscilloscope itself.
