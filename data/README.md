# Data Directory

## Data Format

Data belongs here.
Most of my records should be in the format

```bash
data/<timestamp>/[pickle files here]
```

The timestamp is produced by running the command `int(time.time())`.
Some of the later scans also have an info file inside each directory for
some of the scan parameters.

## Old Data Locations

A lot of the old data is available in the Google Drive.
It should be in the Metamaterials shared google folder.

```bash
Metamaterials/The Other Will/Scanning Microphone/Data/old_computer_metamaterial_scans.tar.xz
```

Just extract the tarball into this directory and you should have access to
all of my previous scans.
