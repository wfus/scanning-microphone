# Setting up the Science Center 3D Printer

This printer is the TAZ-LULZBOT 3D printer in Science Center 102.
If you want to use it, please message Rob! This 3D printer has been confirmed
to work with the Hoffman computer in LISE, it also comes on a wheeled cart
so it's easy to move back and forth if necessary.
