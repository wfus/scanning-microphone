# Setting up the Science Center 3D Printer

This printer is the TAZ-LULZBOT 3D printer in Science Center 102.
If you want to use it, please message Rob! This 3D printer has been confirmed
to work with the Hoffman computer in LISE, it also comes on a wheeled cart
so it's easy to move back and forth if necessary. The 3D printer looks like
this.

## Setup

### Initial Setup

Look at the [previous page](INSTRUCTIONS.md) for setup instructions. For my
setup, I used a computer with Ubuntu 18.04. It should work for 16.04 too,
and it should also work with any 3D printer.

### Connecting the Printer

Make sure you get a USB-A cable. Connect the USB end to the computer, and
make sure you are logged into the computer.


## Troubleshooting

If you have questions, feel free to email `wfu [at] college.harvard.edu` and
I should respond pretty quickly.
