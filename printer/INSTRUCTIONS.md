# Printer setup

We'll be using some code to control the printer, taken from `Printrun`. Since
we want direct control over the 3D printer or other CNC setup we will only
use the core class.

## Installation

First we have to install a few packages. __The code requires the use of Python
3__!

```bash
sudo pip3 install pyserial dbus-python psutil
```
